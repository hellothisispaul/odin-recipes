The Odin Project - Foundations Course
Project: Recipes

Applying foundational knowledge of HTML to build a basic recipe website. Website consists of an index page linking to three additional pages showcasing use of:

- HTML boilerplate
- img and anchor tags
- unodered/ordered lists
- git/GitHub

Reflection:
- HTML provides structure -- website needs styling
- Aware of HTML img sizing, do I wait for CSS?
- Unsure of when appropriate to commit/add to Git
